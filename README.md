	Implemeting our Own Hash Table with Separate Chaining in Java
	Every data structure has its own special charactersitics for example 
	a BST is used when the minimum or maximum element needs to be fetched 
	in constant time. Similarly a hash table is used to fetch, add and remove,
	add and remove an element in constant time. It is necessary for anyone to 
	be clear with the working of a hash table before moving on to the implementation 
	aspect. So here is a breif background on the working of hash able and also it should
	be noted that we will be using Hash Map and Hash Table terminology interchangeably 
	through in Java HashTables are thread safe while HashMaps are not.

							background
	Every hash-table stores data in the form of (key, value) combination. Interestingly
	every key is unique in a Hash Table but values can repeat which means values can be 
	same for different keys present in it. Now as we observe in an array to fetch a value 
	we provide the position/index corresponding to the value in that array. In a Hash Table,
	instead of an index we use a key to fetch the value corresponging to that key. Now the
	entire process is described below.

	Every time a key is generated, the key is passed to a hash function. Every hash function 
	has two parts: Hash Code and Compressor.

	HashCode - 
	Is an integer number (random or nonrandom). In Java every Object has its own hash code.
	We will use the hash code enerated by JVM in our hash function and to compress the Hash
	code we use modulo(%) on the hash code by size of the hash table. So modulo operator Is
	compressor in our implementation.
	The entire process ensures that for any key, we get an integer position within the size of 
	the Hash Table to insert the corresponding value.
	So the process is simple, use gives a (key, value) pair set as input and based on the value
	generated by hash function an index is generated to where the value corresponding to the 
	particular key is stored. So whenever we need to fetch a value corresponding to a key that is
	just O(1) = Constant.
